## Notes

Monster widget - looks great!
Theme Test Data - initial exploration, looks great!

## Code
- JS console.log / output : `error:needs arguments` stickUp.js:39

## Core Functionality and Features
- Fairly extensive use of the customizer. Sanitized throughout. Very good escaping throughout.

## Licensing
- `js/owl.carousel.js` missing license in readme.txt
- (recommended) `js/stickUp.js` missing license in stickUp.js
- All other asset licenses accredited correctly - props!
